    <ul>
        <li>3 skinless, boneless chicken breasts, cut into 1 1/2-inch pieces</li>
        <li>1 cup lemon juice</li>
        <li>4 eggs</li>
        <li>1 stick butter</li>
        <li>1 medium yellow onion, chopped</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon diced fresh ginger</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons diced garlic</li>
        <li>2 cups water</li>
        <li>1 cup basmati rice</li>
        <li>8 teaspoons paprika</li>
        <li>8 teaspoons berbere spice blend, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 (14.5 ounce) can diced fire-roasted tomatoes, or more to taste</li>
        <li>2 cups chicken broth, or more as needed</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine chicken and lemon juice in a bowl and 
            marinate until flavors meld, at least 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Place eggs in a saucepan and cover with water. 
            Bring to a boil, remove from heat, and 
            let eggs stand in hot water for 15 minutes. 
            Remove eggs from hot water, cool under cold running water, and peel.

        </li>
        <li>Melt butter over medium heat in a pot. 
            Add onion, ginger, and garlic to the hot butter and cook until onion is soft, 
            5 to 7 minutes.</li>
        <li>Bring water and rice to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, 
            cover, and simmer until rice is tender and water has been absorbed, 
            25 to 30 minutes. 
            Keep warm.</li>
        <li>While rice cooks, stir paprika and berbere seasoning into the onion mixture, adjusting to taste. 
            Add chicken to the pot and brown, 5 to 7 minutes per side. 
            Pour in tomatoes and stir to combine. 
            Pour in enough chicken broth to thin mixture out to stew consistency.
             Reduce heat and let simmer until chicken is no longer pink in the center, 20 to 30 minutes, 
             adding hard-boiled eggs when stew has about 10 minutes of cooking time left.

        </li>
        <li>Pierce eggs using a fork to allow sauce to seep in. Continue to simmer 10 minutes more. Season with salt and pepper and serve over cooked basmati rice.</li>
    
    </ol>
